3.1. Rounding Numerical Values
#   round() When a value is exactly halfway between two choices, the behavior of round is to round
    to the nearest even digit. That is, values such as 1.5 or 2.5 both get rounded to 2. The number of
    digits given to round() can be negative, in which case rounding takes place for tens, hundreds,
    thousands, and so on.
